splitify
========

`splitify` writes out differences of masses for the splits of the tree.

::

  usage: splitify [options] placefile(s)

Options
=======

-o  Specify the filename to write to.
--out-dir  Specify the directory to write files to.
--prefix  Specify a string to be prepended to filenames.
--point-mass  Treat every pquery as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--kappa  Specify the exponent for scaling between weighted and unweighted splitification. default: 1

Details
=======


The first step to perform edge PCA is to make a matrix with rows indexed by the samples, and columns by the edges of the tree.
The :math:`(s,e)` entry of this matrix is the difference between the distribution of mass on either side of edge :math:`e` for the sample :math:`s`.
Specifically, it is the amount of mass on the distal (non-root) side of edge :math:`e` minus the amount of mass on the proximal side.
The matrix is indexed such that the first numerical column is edge labeled 0 in the reference tree.
The ``splitify`` subcommand simply writes out this matrix.

The ``--kappa`` option enables a componentwise transformation :math:`\varphi_\kappa` on the entries of this matrix.

.. math::
  \varphi_\kappa(x) = \mathrm{sgn}(x) |x|^\kappa

where the :math:`\kappa` parameter can any non-negative number.
This parameter scales between ignoring abundance information (:math:`\kappa = 0`), using it linearly (:math:`\kappa = 1`), and emphasizing it (:math:`\kappa > 1`).
